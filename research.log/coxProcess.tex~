\subsection*{Cox Processes}
A natural extension of a Poisson process is to let $\mu$ be a realization of a random meausre $M$ so that the conditional distribution of $X$ given $M = \mu$ follows a Poisson process with intensity measure $\mu$. Then $X$ is said to be a {\it Cox Process drived by $M$}. 

{\it Next the give some examples}

Cox processes are like inhomogeneous Poisson process models for aggregated pint patterns. Usually in applications $M$ is unobaserved, and so we cannot distinguish a Cox process $X$ from its corresponding Poisson process $X\setminus M$ when only one realization of $X\cap W$ is available(where $W$ denotes the observation window). Which of the two symbols might be most appropritate depends on prior knowledge and the scientific questions to be investigated, the particular application, and annother application is nonparametric Bayesian modelling. 

Distribution paroperties of a Cox process $X$ drived by $M$ follows immediately by conditioning on $M$ and exploiting the properties of the POisson process $X|M$. For instance, $$EN(A) = EM(A)$$ and $$cov(N(A),N(B)) = cov(M(A), M(B)) + EM(A\cap B)$$ for boudned regions $A$ and $B$.
