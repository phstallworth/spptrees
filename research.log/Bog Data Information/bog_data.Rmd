Michael Lavine has said that the measurements in the `plants-all-bogs.csv` file
are measured in mm, starting from the same origin as the 10 x 10 meter grid.
This allows us to plot the plants (red) on the same plot as the sites (black).

```{r read-dat, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
library(dplyr)
d <- read.csv("../plants-all-bogs.csv")
d_12M <-
  d %>%
  filter(bog == "12M")
sx <- rep(1:10, 10)
sy <- rep(1:10, each = 10)
plot(sx, sy, xlab = "", ylab = "", pch = 16)
points(d_12M$plantX / 1000, d_12M$plantY / 1000, pch = 16, col = "red")
```

Which can then be compared to the image from Ellison et al.

It looks like we have a match.
